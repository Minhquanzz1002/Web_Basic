            Imagine the following situation: You’ve got a file that you need to process, and there are a bunch of
            web apps out there that can do it for you, but it’s a sensitive file and you don’t trust that they’re
            not going to upload your file to your server and snoop on your data. For example, you might want to:

                <p>Existing web platform facilities for network communication include WebSocket 19 and WebRTC 10.
                    Each mandates a specific protocol, ensures TLS, and respects the Same Origin Policy 3. The
                    proposed WebTransport 75 is similar in these respects.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, these APIs are impractical when the developer has no control over the endpoint. In
                    general, you can’t create a web app that talks to servers and devices that have their own
                    protocols incompatible with what’s available on the web, e.g. SSH 1, RDP 5 or printer protocols
                    7. Another example is that you can’t create a web app that needs to talk to a legacy system.
                    Requiring users to change or replace said system would be hard as it could be deployed
                    on-premise by countless parties. Similarly, devices often have their own protocols, last for
                    decades, and are expensive to replace.</p>
                <p>Native platforms universally provide APIs to access local network devices and information systems
                    over TCP or UDP. For example, Windows applications can use WinSock 7, and Android applications
                    can use android.net 15. Applications depending on these facilities cannot be ported to the web
                    platform without a rewrite of the servers they connect to (which may range from easy to
                    impossible). Nevertheless, there are risks in adding such a powerful capability to the web
                    platform, for users and their organizations, which need to be carefully considered.</p>
